My 2017 school website project revamped.

- Back in 2017, I was first introduced with basic programming. However the subject was quite overwhelming for me. While marked as "good performance", the website was technically not operational. Many years later, I finally have the knowledge to remaster the website in quick fashion. I planned to keep this little project on Github for ease of access.
